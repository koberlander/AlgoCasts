# Runtime Chart

Type | Equation | Description
---- | -------- | -----------
Constant Time | 1 | The algorithm/operation/etc takes the same amount of time no matter how many elements.

2. Logarithmic Time - *log(n)* - You have this when doubling the amount of elements you have does not double the amount of work.

3. Linear Time - *n* - Iterating through all elements in a collection of data. If you see a loop spanning from '0' to 'array.length', you probably have 'n' or linear time.

4. Quasilinear Time - *n
